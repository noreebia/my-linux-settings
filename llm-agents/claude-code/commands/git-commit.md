description: Create a git commit and push to remote
---

## Context

- Current git status: !`git status`
- Current git diff (staged and unstaged changes): !`git diff HEAD`
- Current branch: !`git branch --show-current`
- Recent commits: !`git log --oneline -10`

## Your task

Based on the above changes, create a single git commit and push it to the remote using `git push -u origin HEAD`.

You have the capability to call multiple tools in a single response. Stage, commit, and push using a single message. Do not use any other tools or do anything else. Do not send any other text or messages besides these tool calls.
